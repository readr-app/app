# About Readr

Readr is a simple web app providing you with a simple service: storing articles on your device, so you can read them later, even when you're offline. This is great when you're commuting regularly and don't have a proper internet connection along the way. Or when you're traveling through countries with bad mobile internet outside of urban areas, like e.g. Germany.

Readr has your back!

At the moment the following news websites are supported:

{{{ supportedSites }}}

The list will steadily grow over time. For all other websites there's a generic importer at work, fetching all the text contents.
